# Codility-Assessment
We astart with a compaerison expression  to evaluate  whether it is true or false  depending on the relation between a and b
- String.prototype.repeat() method repeats a string a certain number of times...(The multiplication of a string with a boolean value converts the boolean to an integer (0 or 1), which is used to select one of the two strings '-' or '+'.)
-the || operstor  is used to replace the value of b with a a sting "equal to " if be is falsy(null or false)
-we also interpolate the value of a,b and 'sign' into a single string
